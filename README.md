## Introduction

The goal of this project is fully automate macOS workstation using Ansible.
I have currently implemented the following:

* **macOS & Software Defaults**: Updating of plist properties for various
  aspects of macOS and software configuration.  This uses a custom plist module
  which allows for complex updates of plist files far beyond the defaults
  command.  The plist module is a modified version of
  [Matthias Neugebauer's plist module](https://github.com/mtneug/ansible-modules-plist).
* **Unix Package Installation**: This is being accomplish with the use of
  [homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew).
* **Development Setup**: Installation and configuration of technologies
  such as Python, Node.js and Docker.
* **Desktop Application Installation**: This is being performed with the use
  of [homebrew-cask](https://github.com/caskroom/homebrew-cask).
* **Appstore Application Check**: Perform a check to see if the app is
  installed, and notify the user that they must install it from the App Store if it isn't.
* **Configuration Files & Symlinks**: Any files and folders that are to be 
  copied or symlinked, including app settings, licenses and dotfiles.
* **Dock Configuration**: Automatic building of the Dock using
  [dockutil](https://github.com/kcrawford/dockutil).
* **Launchpad Configuration**: Automatic building of Launchpad layout
  using my own developed utility (see
  [launchpad.py](https://github.com/fgimian/macbuild/blob/master/extras/launchpad.py)).
* **Default Apps**: File associations for various applications using
  [duti](https://github.com/moretension/duti).
* **Startup Setup**: Ensures that the required items start on startup using
  [loginitems](https://github.com/OJFord/loginitems).
* **Terminal Customisation**: Setting up the Terminal using JXA.

## Quick Start

Before you get started, you may wish to perform the following steps to save
time and ensure everything works as expected:

1. Copy a Homebrew cache backup to `~/Library/Caches/Homebrew`
2. Copy App Store apps that you have previously downloaded to `/Applications`
3. Copy `System Automation` containing various settings and licenses to `~/Documents`
4. Install Apple's Command Line Tools manually to avoid them being re-downloaded

Now, run the following in your Terminal to use my configuration:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/navdove/macbuild.git
cd macbuild
./macbuild.sh
```

It is strongly suggested that you reboot your Mac after the first run
of this tool.

If you wish to install the various sample libraries and sound packs, connect
one of your backup drives and run the following:

```bash
./extras/samples.py
```

## Manual Tasks

The following tasks must be performed manually as I have yet to find a way to
automate them.

### Installation & Configuration (macOS)

* **Finder**: Setup sidebar containing favourites
* **Services**: In System Preferences / Keyboard / Services, enable 'New Terminal at Folder' and 'New Terminal Tab at Folder'
* **Screen Saver**: Set the screen saver to 'Flurry'
* **Notification Centre**: Set the order of items and allow permission
* **Safari**: Install extensions (1Password and Adblock Plus)
* **App Store Login Items**: Start App Store menubar apps and set them to start
  at login (AppCleaner and OneDrive)
* **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Under System Preferences / Keyboard:
    - Set 'Show Launchpad' to F14 under 'Launchpad & Dock'
    - Set 'Show Notification Center' to F15 under 'Mission Control'
    - Set 'Show Desktop' to F13 under 'Mission Control'
    - Disable 'Show Dashboard' under 'Mission Control'

### Installation & Configuration (General)

* **Audio Hijack**: Start the app multiple times to dismiss welcome and mailing
  list alerts.  You must also install Instant On to ensure the app works.
* **Clear**: Enable iCloud

  launchd starting it for the first time.
